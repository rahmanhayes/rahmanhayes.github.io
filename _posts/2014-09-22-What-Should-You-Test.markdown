<p>Currently reading "Testing Python: Applying Unit Testing, TDD, BDD, and Acceptance Testing" By David Sale. One of the passages asked the question what should you test in Unit Testing:

"...unit testing makes the task easier as the whole idea is to focus on the smallest units of code rather than thinking about how to test the large application you are putting together as a whole. Before you write any code you give thought to the kind of tests you will be writing to check the methods will work as expected. As you write more and more unit tests you will gain experience in what works well and what
perhaps causes you issues later down the line."</p>
