I thought I would post a Reading List of current books that I am reading for the month. I may put other items on this post besides books as Books tend to take longer than a month to read. 

- "Practical Data Analysis" By Hector Cuesta
- "Python: Create-Modify-Reuse" By Jim Knowlton
- "Learning SQL" By Alan Beaulieu
